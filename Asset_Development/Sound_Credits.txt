Using Audacity to edit sounds.


Sounds I want;
- Background; Droning sounds of belts moving *Done
- Indicator; some sound to play when objects enter the turntable  *Done *NOPE.. That sounds really annoying actually. 
- Effect; Some sound to play when objects are despawned?
- Effect; some sound top lay when objecst are spawned? (Unsure about this.. may pollute sound space)
